# credit_card_fraud_detection
The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

For many banks, retaining highly profitable customers is the number one business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal for different banks. In terms of substantial financial losses, trust, and credibility, this is a concerning issue to both banks and customers alike.


It has been estimated by the Nilson Report that by 2020, banking frauds will account for $30 billion worldwide. With the rise in digital payment channels, the number of fraudulent transactions is also increasing in new and different ways. 
 

In the banking industry, credit card fraud detection using machine learning is not only a trend but a necessity for them to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning is helping these institutions to reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees as well as denials of legitimate transactions.
